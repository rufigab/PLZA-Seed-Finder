# PLZA Seed Finder Plugin for PKHeX

A specialized seed finding plugin for PKHeX that generates **valid, legal Pokémon** for Pokémon Legends: Z-A by finding proper origin seeds that satisfy PLZA's strict correlation requirements.

## The Problem This Solves

### Why You Need This Plugin

Pokémon Legends: Z-A uses a sophisticated seed correlation system where **every Pokémon must have a valid origin seed** that correlates correctly with its PID, EC, IVs, and other properties. Unlike previous generation games, you cannot simply generate a Pokémon with random values - the game validates that all properties were generated from the same seed using the **Xoroshiro128+ RNG algorithm**.

**Without proper seed correlation:**
- PKHeX will flag Pokémon as invalid
- Generated Pokémon fail legality checks
- You cannot create legal Shiny Alpha Pokémon
- Mystery Gift and Static encounters fail validation
- Pokémon will be rejected in online trades

### How This Plugin Helps

This plugin **searches through millions of valid seeds** to find ones that produce Pokémon matching your exact specifications. Instead of randomly generating values and hoping they correlate, it:

1. **Finds valid origin seeds** that produce your desired Pokémon
2. **Ensures proper correlation** between PID, EC, IVs, nature, and all other properties
3. **Generates legally valid Pokémon** that pass PKHeX validation
4. **Supports all encounter types** (Wild, Static, Gift, Trade)
5. **Handles special cases** like Shiny Alpha Pokémon that have complex PID+ correlation

## Requirements

- PKHeX (latest version recommended)
- Windows 10 or 11
- .NET 9.0 runtime (usually already installed if you can run PKHeX)

## Installation

1. Download the latest `PLZASeedFinderPlugin.dll` from the releases page
2. Place it in PKHeX's `plugins` folder (create the folder if it doesn't exist)
3. Restart PKHeX
4. You'll find "PLZA Seed Finder" in the Tools menu

## Usage

### Basic Search
1. Open the plugin from Tools > PLZA Seed Finder
2. Search or select your target Pokémon species
3. Choose the form if applicable
4. Select which encounter sources to search (Wild, Static, Gift, Trade)
5. Set your search criteria
6. Click Search

### Understanding PLZA Seed Requirements

Each encounter type has different seed correlation patterns:

**Wild Encounters (EncounterSlot9a)**
- Variable levels within encounter range
- Can be Alpha or normal
- Seed determines all properties including Alpha status
- Shiny Alpha requires special PID+ correlation

**Static Encounters (EncounterStatic9a)**
- Fixed level and location
- Often legendary Pokémon
- May have minimum flawless IVs
- Some have fixed natures or abilities

**Gift Pokémon (EncounterGift9a)**
- Fixed trainer data (OT, TID, SID)
- Examples: starters, fossils, special event gifts
- Plugin handles proper trainer info automatically
- Seed still determines IVs, nature, shininess

**In-Game Trades (EncounterTrade9a)**
- Completely fixed properties
- Specific OT, nature, ability
- Seed variation is minimal
- Mainly for completion purposes

### Search Tips

**For Best Results:**
1. **Start with wide IV ranges** - Finding 6IV Pokémon requires searching billions of seeds
2. **Use species filter** - Type to quickly find your target Pokémon
3. **Check encounter sources** - Plugin shows which types are available
4. **Specify shiny early** - Shiny determination happens first in RNG chain
5. **Set realistic max results** - 100-500 is usually sufficient
6. **Use hex seed ranges** - Format: `0000000000000000` to `00000000FFFFFFFF`

**For Shiny Alphas:**
- These are the hardest to find due to PID+ correlation
- Expect longer search times (10-30 minutes for good IVs)
- Square vs Star is determined by XOR value
- Your TID/SID from save file affects shiny determination

**Performance Expectations:**
- Modern 8-core CPU: ~80,000-120,000 seeds/second
- Finding specific shiny: typically 1-5 million seeds
- Finding 5-6IV shiny: 10-100 million seeds
- Finding shiny alpha with good IVs: 50-500 million seeds

## Building from Source

If you want to build the plugin yourself:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `PLZASeedFinderPlugin.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 or later
3. Ensure you have the PKHeX.Core NuGet package referenced
4. Build in Release mode
5. The compiled DLL will be in `bin/Release/net9.0-windows/`

## Technical Details

### PLZA Seed Correlation System

Pokémon Legends: Z-A uses a **Xoroshiro128+ RNG algorithm** (via LumioseRNG in PKHeX.Core) where every Pokémon property is generated sequentially from a single 64-bit origin seed. The correlation must be perfect:

```
Seed → EC → PID → IVs → Ability → Gender → Nature → Height/Weight → Moves
```

Each value advances the RNG state in a specific pattern. If any value doesn't match what the seed should produce, the Pokémon is **invalid**. This is why random generation fails - you can't just pick values you want; they must all come from the same seed.

### The PID+ Correlation Challenge

The most difficult case is **Shiny Alpha Pokémon**, which require PID+ correlation. The algorithm must:
1. Generate the initial PID from the seed
2. Check if it's shiny based on your TID/SID
3. If not shiny but needed, try again with RollCount=1
4. Validate the final PID matches the expected pattern

This involves up to **131,072 seed operations** per attempt. Without proper seed searching, generating valid Shiny Alphas is nearly impossible.

### How This Plugin Works

**Search Algorithm:**
1. Takes user-defined criteria (IVs, nature, shiny, etc.)
2. Iterates through seed ranges using parallel processing
3. For each seed:
   - Quick validates if seed could produce desired criteria
   - Generates full Pokémon using PKHeX.Core's LumioseRNG
   - Verifies all properties match requirements
   - Validates correlation is correct
4. Returns only seeds that produce valid, legal Pokémon

**Encounter Type Support:**
- **EncounterSlot9a**: Wild encounters with variable levels and Alpha status
- **EncounterStatic9a**: Fixed encounters like legendaries with set properties
- **EncounterGift9a**: Gift Pokémon with specific trainer data (handles fixed OT/TID)
- **EncounterTrade9a**: In-game trades with locked properties

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Multi-threaded parallel search across CPU cores
- Quick pre-validation before full generation
- Batch processing in 10,000 seed chunks
- Real-time result streaming
- Smart SearchShiny1 toggle when loading results (instant loading vs 5-30 second delay)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why can't I just use regular PKHeX generation?

Regular PKHeX generation doesn't search for seeds - it either:
1. Uses a random seed (which likely won't produce your desired values)
2. Tries to find a seed but may fail for complex requirements
3. Doesn't guarantee proper correlation for all PLZA encounter types

This plugin **brute-force searches millions of seeds** to find ones that actually produce what you want.

### What happens if I use a Pokémon without proper seed correlation?

- **PKHeX marks it invalid** with correlation errors
- **May be rejected in online trades** or competitions
- **Other players may report it** as hacked/illegal
- **You waste time** creating Pokémon that can't be used

### Why are Shiny Alphas so hard to generate?

Shiny Alphas require **PID+ correlation** where:
1. The seed must produce a shiny PID using RollCount=1
2. The PID must pass additional correlation checks
3. This requires trying up to 131,072 operations per seed
4. Only ~1 in 4,096 shinies are valid Shiny Alphas

Without seed searching, finding valid Shiny Alphas is nearly impossible.

### Can I use the same seed for different Pokémon?

No! Each seed produces a **specific set of properties**:
- Different species have different gender ratios
- Different encounters have different flawless IV counts
- Personal Info affects ability slots
- The seed that produces a shiny male Sprigatito won't produce a shiny female Fennekin

Always search for seeds per Pokémon/encounter combination.

### How do I know if my generated Pokémon is valid?

After loading a result into PKHeX:
1. Check the legality indicator (should be ✓ Valid)
2. Look for any red/orange flags in the legality analysis
3. Specifically check for "PID mismatch" or "correlation" errors
4. If you see "Invalid: Encounter Type PID mismatch" → bad seed correlation

All Pokémon generated by this plugin should pass validation.

### Why does my search take so long?

Search time depends on criteria difficulty:
- **Easy (5 seconds)**: Any shiny with random IVs
- **Medium (1-5 minutes)**: Specific nature shiny with 4-5IVs
- **Hard (10-30 minutes)**: Shiny Alpha with 5-6IVs
- **Very Hard (hours)**: Perfect 6IV Shiny Alpha with specific nature

Use wider IV ranges to find results faster.

### Can this plugin modify save files or inject Pokémon?

**No**. This plugin only:
- Searches for seeds
- Generates Pokémon in PKHeX's editor (not your save)
- Exports data to CSV

You must manually save the Pokémon to your save file using PKHeX's normal functions.
